This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Thinking you're senior Developer UI for 30 years. The component is a complex calendar that displays events or reservations in different views (month, week, day). Here are some areas that I could improve:
Responsiveness issues:
The component has some mobile adjustments but could be improved
Some text might be too small on mobile devices
Layout structure could be better optimized for different screen sizes
UI consistency:
Some spacing and padding might be inconsistent
Typography hierarchy could be improved
Visual hierarchy and information density could be better balanced
Performance considerations:
The component is quite large and complex
Many state variables and calculations
Visual enhancements:
Could add better transitions and animations
Could improve color accessibility and contrast
Could improve the overall aesthetic feel
I'll focus on making targeted improvements to enhance the UI while keeping the core functionality intact. I'll make the component more responsive, visually appealing, and user-friendly.
